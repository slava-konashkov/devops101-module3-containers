Thank you for contacting our support team regarding your container issue. In order to better understand the problem and provide a solution, we kindly ask you to send us some additional information.

First, we would like you to record a terminal session using https://asciinema.org/. This will help us better understand the steps you have taken and what may be causing the issue.

Additionally, we would like you to perform and record the creation of container specification and the network configuration process. This will help us determine if there are any network-related issues that may be contributing to the problem.

Please send us the recorded terminal session in your google cloud shell (https://shell.cloud.google.com/) using the following steps:

1. Install asciinema by running (for Ubuntu):

sudo apt-get install asciinema

2. Start recording the terminal session by running and following the prompts:

asciinema rec 

3. Run the steps to init container specification: 

runc spec

4. Add network configuration for your container spec file

5. Setup network interfaces to reproduce the issue

6. Stop the recording by pressing Ctrl-D.

7. Share the recording URL with us by running asciinema upload and sending us the resulting URL.
